Hey, I'm Luo** (a.k.a. @Ronan), a laid-back youth who majors in Electronic Information Science and Technology, with a bit of knowledge in Computer Science and Art, a 'jack of all trades, master of none'.

I have completed the full 'nine-year compulsory education' as mandated by the Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China, and now consider myself a cultured person.
